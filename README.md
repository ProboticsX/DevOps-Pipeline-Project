### What progress we have made ‚úÖ
This section aims to explain about the current progress that we have successfully completed after continuing from the CHECKPOINT-M1.md

- We decided to use ansible for further task, as it would be make our job easier for the future too.
- To run ansible, we created two VMs named **ansible** and **pipeline**. ansible is used as host VM and pipeline is used to run the build.
- In ```pipeline.init``` we create the VMs using the  ```bakerx``` comnand.

- We set up the keys for the VMs so that the communication between the VMs is seemless.
- We then, run the ansible install commands 
  ```
  - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
  - sudo apt-get update
  - sudo apt-get install ansible -y
  ```

- After the ansible installation, we run the ansible playbook named **build.yml**
-  In the build.yml file, the dependencies required for iTrust are downloaded
-  The following dependencies are downloaded
   ```
   - Node.js
   - wget
   - git
   - maven
   - jdk 11
   - mysql
   - mvn
   ```

-  To clone iTrust from github, github access tokens is used
-  Also the password required for mySQL is taken from the ```.env``` file
-  Then finally to build iTrust and all run all test, the following command is used

### What challenges we had and what we learned from them üòé

### What challenges we had and what we learned from them üòé

- Running Ansible in Windows
  - Ansible is available for Windows, but only as a client, we wanted to run ansible as a host, so to overcome this challenge we created two VMs and used one VM as a host ```ansible``` and the other VM as web server ```pipeline```

- Cloning iTrust using Ansible
  - The challenge faced here was in cloning the ```iTrust``` repo that required the user name and password to be specified while running the command which we neither wanted to disclose nor did we wanted to put in ```.env```
  - Hence, we used the GitHub token to pass it as a password hence we were able to overcome this challenge.

- Setting up password for SQL
 - The major requirement for setting up iTrust is the installation of ```mysql``` which needs username and password to be passed from ```.env```. Finally, we were able to set the mysql password through ```my.cnf.j2``` plugin.

```
 - name: copy .my.cnf file with mysql root password credentials
    become: yes
    template: src=my.cnf.j2 dest=/root/.my.cnf owner=root mode=0600
    tags: iTrust-build
``` 


### Team Contributions üë•	

  - We started with the setup of ansible
  - We created two VMs to setup ansible
  - Used github access token for cloning the iTrust
  - We set up mySQL password for iTrust
  - Downloaded all the required dependencies for iTrust
  - Ran the ansible playbook to build iTrust and successfully ran all the test cases.
