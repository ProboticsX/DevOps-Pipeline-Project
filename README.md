# README.md (F0)

### What progress I have made âœ…
This section aims to explain about the current progress that we have successfully completed after continuing from the M3.md

- The new feature has been successfully deployed on top of the orginal pipeline.
- Two different open source project has been used
  - One - Django Web App
  - Two - React App
- The django project has been deployed on green server, where as the react app has been deployed on the blue server.
- The new feature of** Monitoring** has been implemented on top of the current pipeline.
- The monitor droplet is used to for the Monitoring pipeline.

The commands used for running the project are as follows:

``` 
pipeline init
pipeline build itrust-build build.yml
pipeline build F0_build build.yml
pipeline test F0_test build.yml
pipeline prod up
pipeline deploy inventory F0_deploy build.yml
pipeline deploy inventory monitor-deploy build.yml
pipeline deploy inventory django_stats build.yml
pipeline build vehicle-build build.yml
pipeline test vehicle-test build.yml
pipeline deploy inventory vehicle-deploy build.yml
pipeline deploy inventory react_stats build.yml

```

- The F0 is the django webapp
- The vehicle is the react app
- Seperate jobs for building and testing are used
