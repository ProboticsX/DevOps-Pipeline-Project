# CHECKPOINT-M1.md

### What progress we have made
This section aims to explain about the current progress that we have successfully completed uptill now.

- Firstly, we all read the project M1 description carefully and opened issues on github accordingly. Moreover, we assigned each team member some issue task to be completed so that we all can make regular progress in our work.

- After cloning the Pipeline-Template repo, we created VM named "pipeline" (using bakerx) and then proceeded further.
