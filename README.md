### What progress we have made ‚úÖ


This section aims to explain about the current progress that we have successfully completed after continuing from the M2.md

- The provisioning and configuring of computing environment for ```pipeline``` was done successfully.
- Creation of ```.jar``` file for iTrut deployment is done successfully.
- Creation of blue and green droplets using the ``` pipeline prod up``` is done successfully.
- ```inventory.json``` file to save the dropet information is created successfully.
- Triggering of build job ```pipeline deploy inventory itrust-deploy build.yml``` is done successfully.
- Deployment of iTrust using the blue-green stratergy is done successfully.

The commands used for running the project are as follows:

``` 
pipeline init
pipeline build itrust-build build.yml
pipeline prod up
pipeline deploy inventory itrust-deploy build.yml
```

***Note***: Make sure that ```.env``` file is in the below format:
```
Git_Token = <ENTER GITHUB TOKEN>
mySQL_passwd = <ENTER MYSQL PASSWORD>
DO_TOKEN = <ENTER DROPLET TOKEN>
```
### What challenges we had and what we learned from them üòé

- Error in installing the dependencies in droplet via a vm 
  - We initially tried to install the necessary dependdencies for iTrust in a droplet via a vm. However, multiple times there were connection time out error, or connection refused errors, we evene tried to use await and a promise.
  - Hence, we resolved the error by installing the dependencies in the droplet from the host machine, instead of double ssh into droplet.
  
- Exporting the iTrust project in a ```.jar``` or ```.war```
  - The challenge faced here was that the ```.war``` file was created, but the issues arises with the new version of iTrust, and setting the correct path of Tomcat.
  - As a result, we chose to use the ```.jar``` file to deploy iTrust.

- Creation of proxy server for blue-green deployment
  - The issue faced here was that we were creating the proxy server, however there were issues with ip masking, for blue-green deployment.
  - Hence, this was solved by properly using the proxy server and resolving the errors in it, so as to properly mask the ips.
