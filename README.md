- The new feature of** Monitoring** has been implemented on top of the current pipeline.
- The monitor droplet is used to for the Monitoring pipeline.

The commands used for running the project are as follows:

``` 
pipeline init
pipeline build itrust-build build.yml
pipeline build F0_build build.yml
pipeline test F0_test build.yml
pipeline prod up
pipeline deploy inventory F0_deploy build.yml
pipeline deploy inventory monitor-deploy build.yml
pipeline deploy inventory django_stats build.yml
pipeline build vehicle-build build.yml
pipeline test vehicle-test build.yml
pipeline deploy inventory vehicle-deploy build.yml
pipeline deploy inventory react_stats build.yml

```

- The F0 is the django webapp
- The vehicle is the react app
- Seperate jobs for building and testing are used
