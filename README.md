# README.md (Mutation Coverage)

### What progress we have made ‚úÖ
This section aims to explain about the current progress that we have successfully completed after continuing from the M1.md

- We have made changes to our project to utilise only one VM ```pipeline``` and dropped the idea of using ```ansible```
- The provisioning and configuring of computing environment for ```pipeline``` was done successfully.
- We performed the 1000 iterations using random mutation operators.
- Triggering of build job ```pipeline build mutation-coverage build.yml``` was done successfully 
- The result for each mutation involved details such as operator changed, pixel differences, line changed and the final result.

The commands used for running the project are as follows:

``` 
pipeline init
pipeline build mutation-coverage build.yml
```
 <-----------SS showing 1000 iterations were completed successfully---------------->
 <-----------SS showing result.json---------------->

***Note***: Make sure that ```.env``` file is in the below format:
```
Git_Token = <ENTER GITHUB TOKEN>
mySQL_passwd = <ENTER MYSQL PASSWORD>
```
### What challenges we had and what we learned from them üòé

- Error in capturing the snapshot in ```screenshot.js```
  - While rendering the ```.js``` file after applying the mutations, we were not able to capture the snapshot of the changed ```.js``` file because of some syntax error since we applied some mutations in the file.
  - Hence, we resolved the error using the ```try/catch``` clause so that the syntax error doesn't close the whole process.
  
- Rendering the 4 files using ```final.sh```
  - The challenge faced here was while rendering the four files given to us, there was a major challenge in handling the ouputs for each iteration in ```build.yml```
  - As a result, the whole logic for handling mutations was done in ```final.sh```

- Using ```git reset --hard```
  - The issue faced here was that we were creating the ```marqdown-mod.js``` everytime we were running iteration.
  - Hence, we used ```git reset --hard``` to revert the changed ```.js``` to its original state.
